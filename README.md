# ✈️ CloudTrip – Flight Booking Console Application

CloudTrip is a simple yet powerful **flight booking system** built with Ruby that enables users to search and book flights based on multiple criteria. The application uses **file-based storage** (`data.txt`) to manage flight availability and booking information.

## 📌 Features

### Basic Flight Search
- Search for flights by entering **source** and **destination**.
- Only flights with **available seats** are shown.
- If no flights are found, the system displays: `"No Flights Available"`.

### Search by Departure Date
- Include a **departure date** in your search.
- View **departure and arrival times** in the results.

### Available Seats Filter
- System filters out all **fully booked** flights automatically.

### Input Number of Passengers
- Enter how many passengers you're booking for.
- Only flights with **enough seats** will be displayed.

### Filter by Class Type
- Choose between:
  - Economic
  - Second
  - First class
- Results show only flights with seats available in the selected class.

### Fare Estimation
- The system calculates **total fare** based on:
  - Class type
  - Number of passengers
  - Base price
  - Pricing strategy (dynamic pricing)

### Dynamic Pricing Logic
- Seat-based pricing
- Date-based pricing

### ✅ Round Trip Support *(Optional)*
- Book **round trips** with a **5% discount**.
- Return flights must also match passenger and class criteria.
